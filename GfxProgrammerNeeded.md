We're looking for someone with some experience with OpenGL and/or GX (on the Gamecube) who would like to help out with the emulator to port a graphics plugin. Anyone interested should check out the sources for:

Mupen64 Soft GFX (We're not doing software gfx, but I think it is well designed for writing a plugin from scratch)
> I currently think that rewriting this plugin to use the GX is the best strategy because the simplicity of the plugin, and it is very well designed.  It's included in the source of Mupen64

[Glide64](http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=37658&page=12) _scroll to the bottom to download_ (only the wrapper needs porting)

[Rice Video](http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=41037&highlight=rice) (some cool features like Hi-Res textures)

```
```

_**UPDATE**_
> As most that have been paying attention to the emulator's progress have probably noticed, sepp256 has answered our call for a graphics programmer, and he has been doing a very good job porting the software gfx plugin.  However, I don't want anyone to be discouraged from helping out.  It's a big task, and I'm sure it'd be nice to have a helping hand.  Also, there's nothing wrong with someone working on a different graphics plugins; different plugins are better at different games and what not, so its always an option to have more than one plugin available for the emulator.
