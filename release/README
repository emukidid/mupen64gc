QUICK USAGE:
 * ROMs can be z64 (big-endian) or v64 (little endian), or .n64, of any size
 * To install: Extract the contents of wii64-beta1.zip to the root of your SD card
 * For SD/USB: Put ROMs in the directory named /wii64/roms,
    All save types will automatically be placed in /wii64/saves
 * For DVD: ROMs may be anywhere on the disc  
 * Load the executable from the HBC or in the loader of your choice
    Once loaded, select 'Load ROM' and choose the source and select the ROM to load
      (Note: to go up a directory select '..', B will exit the file browser)
 * Select 'Play Game' to play
   The game can be exited any time by pressing X and Y together on a GC pad or Classic Controller,
   1 and 2 together on a Wiimote (only with Nunchuck attached), or the reset button
     (Note: this must be done to save your game; it will not be done automatically)

Controls:
* Gamecube controllers are mapped 1:1 with N64 buttons
* Classic controllers are mapped the same as on VC titles but Z is mapped to both
   ZL and ZR for ease of use
   * X+Y are used to exit to the menu on both classic controller and Gamecube controller
* Wiimote+Nunchuck mappings are:
   * Left-stick: Nunchuk-stick
   * A: A
   * B: + or -
   * Z: Nunchuk Z
   * L: Nunchuk C
   * R: B
   * Start: Home
   * C-stick: D-pad
   * D-pad: 2 + D-pad

   * 2xSaI Tex: Scale and Interpolate in-game textures (unstable on GC)
   * FB Textures: Enable framebuffer textures (necessary for some games to
