NOTE: There are several different executables
	Wii executables have the prefix wii64, GC: mupen64gc
	*-glN64: port of glN64 graphics plugin: best compatibility/speed
	*-GX: original plugin using software graphics framework: works well with a few games
	*-sft: software graphics by Hactarux: extremely slow, but works for more games than GX

USAGE:
 * ROMs must be z64 (big-endian) or v64 (little endian <= 15 MB on GC <= 32 MB on Wii)
 * For SDCARD: Put ROMs in a directory named N64ROMS in the root directory,
               Create a directory for named N64SAVES in the root directory
 * For DVD: ROMs may be anywhere on the disc  
 * Load your choice of executable in the loader of your choice
   Select 'Load ROM' and choose the source and select the ROM to load
     (Note: to go up a directory select '..', B will exit the file browser)
   If there are any saves to load choose 'Load Save File' and select source
   Select 'Play Game' to play
   The game can be exited any time by pressing X and Y together or the reset button
     (Note: this must be done to save your game; it will not be done automatically)
   Save your progress by choosing 'Save Game' and selecting the destination
 * You can save your games on the internal memory on the Wii which will behave
     like a native save game in that it can be copied/deleted via the Wii menu
