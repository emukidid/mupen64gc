The blight's input plugin source is included in the mupen64 source code for
convenience of the end user who want to have it compiled and installed at
the same time than mupen64. Blight is also distributing it separately on
emutalk.net , if you plan to modify the plugin or want to check if a newer
version is available, be sure to check the message board and search for
blight plugin.
